# Matlab-GANs
## I think i might be loosing sanity because
because I am starting to love matlab the same way my lecturers do. I have been always 
wondering why every person on my university is coming down over this software. It looks like it looks,
strange, dirty. Well, stupid I've been. Matlab is one awful beast. But if thou have sanity to control it,
would thou possess such enormus power, that the whole universe would tremble under thy feet.<br>
